# Isolate Name Server

## Features

A registry for SendPorts that can be used across Isolates.

This is basically a port of the [IsolateNameServer class available in Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/IsolateNameServer-class.html).

## Getting started

This package makes use of FFI and native code and hence needs the associated native share library.
Its planned for it to make use of the new (experimental) [Dart native assets feature](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/50565#issuecomment-1570493210) in the future to make this transparent for package users.

## Usage

See the [documentation for the IsolateNameServer class available in Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/IsolateNameServer-class.html).
